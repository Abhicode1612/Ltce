Give PEAS and State Space description : Vacuum-cleaner World 
PEAS Description:

Performance measure: The performance of the vacuum cleaner agent is measured by the number of clean squares and the time taken to clean them all.
Environment: The environment is a rectangular grid of squares that can either be clean or dirty. The vacuum cleaner agent can move to any square and clean it if it is dirty.
Actuators: The actuators available to the agent are moving in one of four directions (up, down, left, right) and cleaning the current square.
Sensors: The sensors available to the agent are the current location of the agent, the status of the current square (clean or dirty), and any obstacles or boundaries.
State Space Description:
The state space of the vacuum cleaner world consists of all possible combinations of the following factors:

The location of the vacuum cleaner agent
The status of each square in the environment (clean or dirty)
The location of any obstacles or boundaries in the environment
The direction that the agent is currently facing
At any given moment, the agent can observe the status of the square it is currently occupying and any obstacles or boundaries in its immediate vicinity. The agent can choose to move in any of the four directions or clean the current square. The state space of the vacuum cleaner world is finite, as there are only a limited number of possible configurations of the environment. However, the size of the state space grows exponentially with the size of the environment.






2.	Give PEAS and State Space description : Internet Shopping Agent 
PEAS Description:

Performance measure: The performance of the internet shopping agent is measured by the number of successful purchases made and the time taken to complete them.
Environment: The environment is an online shopping website that offers a wide range of products for purchase. The internet shopping agent can access the website, browse the products, add items to the cart, and complete the purchase process.
Actuators: The actuators available to the agent are browsing the website, selecting products, adding them to the cart, and completing the checkout process.
Sensors: The sensors available to the agent are the current status of the shopping cart, the product inventory, the user's payment details, and any error messages or notifications from the website.
State Space Description:
The state space of the internet shopping agent consists of all possible combinations of the following factors:

The current page of the website that the agent is browsing
The current contents of the shopping cart
The inventory of available products on the website
The payment information of the user
At any given moment, the agent can observe the current page of the website and the available products, add items to the cart, and proceed to the checkout process. The state space of the internet shopping agent is very large, as it depends on the size of the product inventory and the number of pages on the website. Additionally, the state space can change dynamically as the user navigates the website and makes changes to their shopping cart. Therefore, the internet shopping agent needs to use efficient algorithms and strategies to navigate the state space and make successful purchases.
